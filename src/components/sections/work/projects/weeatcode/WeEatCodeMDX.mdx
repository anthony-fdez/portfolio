WeEatCode is a fullstack blog web application. Users can create an
account, create a blog post, start a conversation under any post and
downvote and upvote any post or comment.

The comment section was inspired by reddit, with infiiitely nestted comments.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

Front End was created with NextJS, so each post created by the users
is indexed by google, improving SEO significantly. Implemented a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get text editor for creating posts.

- React
- Typescript
- NextJS
- Redux
- TipTap WYSIWYG Editor

### Backend

Implemented key infrastructure on the backend and created routes and
models to handle user authentication, CRUD actions to the databases
such as following users, and upvoting posts.

- NodeJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Jest

## Sources

Unfortunatly, the website is no longer live (turns out its not really a smart finantial move to have QA and Prod instances and database, and no one using it), but you can still check
out the source code, and run it locally if you want!
