account, create a blog post, start a conversation under any post and
downvote and upvote any post or comment.

The comment section was inspired by reddit, with infiiitely nestted comments.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

Front End was created with NextJS, so each post created by the users
is indexed by google, improving SEO significantly. Implemented a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get text editor for creating posts.

- React
- Typescript
- NextJS
- Redux
- TipTap WYSIWYG Editor

### Backend

Implemented key infrastructure on the backend and created routes and
models to handle user authentication, CRUD actions to the databases
such as following users, and upvoting posts.

- NodeJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Jest

<Alert title="Heads up">
  This website is no longer live. As it turns out, running QA and Prod ec2
  instances and databases without an audience is about as financially savvy as
  buying a yacht to sail in a desert. But don't despair! You can still get a
  peek behind the curtain by checking out the source code. And if you're feeling
  particularly adventurous, feel free to run it locally. It's like having your
  very own ghost town website!
