## Tech Stack

### Frontend

Front End was created with NextJS, so each post created by the users
is indexed by google, improving SEO significantly. Implemented a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get text editor for creating posts.

- React
- Typescript
- NextJS
- Redux
- TipTap WYSIWYG Editor

### Backend

Implemented key infrastructure on the backend and created routes and
models to handle user authentication, CRUD actions to the databases
such as following users, and upvoting posts.

- NodeJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Jest
