As a full stack software engineer, I've had the opportunity
to spend over three years contributing to a variety of websites
and mobile applications. Whether working independently or
collaborating with a team of skilled developers, my aim
has always been to create modern and robust software.

My journey has primarily involved working on front-end codebases
with a focus on ReactJS. However, I'm no stranger to adapting to
new JS frameworks and tools as needed, demonstrating my capacity
for flexibility and continuous learning.

Beyond my front-end experience, I've also engaged with backend languages
and frameworks like NodeJS. Additionally, I've become familiar with both
SQL and noSQL databases, further expanding my skill set. My objective
is to continue applying and broadening these skills to create impactful
solutions in the software industry.
