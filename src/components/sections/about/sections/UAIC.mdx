# Frontend Software Engineer

In my role as a Front-End Engineer, I oversaw the full spectrum
of designing and developing user-centric interfaces. A pivotal project
during my tenure was the development of
[a new company website](https://uaig.net/) utilizing ReactJS and TypeScript.
This initiative significantly enhanced the user interaction and
improved the site's Search Engine Optimization (SEO), leading to
increased visibility and traffic.

In an effort to maintain technological relevancy, I undertook
the migration of several internal websites and tools from
legacy codebases to contemporary technologies in line with
industry standards. Alongside this, I worked closely with the
backend team to integrate APIs using PHP, NodeJS, and JAVA,
thereby optimizing our infrastructure for improved system
performance.

My role also encompassed working with Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) backend codebases in PHP and JAVA, enhancing
my understanding of backend operations. This broadened my
ability to facilitate seamless collaboration between front-end
and back-end teams.
